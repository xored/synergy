\n\

Xored warrants solely that the Software will perform substantially in\n\
accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of\n\
ninety (90) days after the date on which You purchase the License for\n\
the Software. Xored does not make any warranties with respect to\n\
portions of the SOFTWARE that are owned by Xored’s licensors; however,\n\
Xored will pass through to you any warranties made by such licensors, to\n\
the extent such warranties are transferable. Xored does not warrant the\n\
use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free at all times and\n\
in all circumstances, nor that program errors will be corrected. This\n\
limited warranty shall not apply to any error or failure resulting from\n\
(i) machine error, (ii) Licensee’s failure to follow operating\n\
instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or (iv) modifications to the\n\

sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all or any portion of the\n\
Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose, Licensee’s sole\n\
remedy and Xored’s maximum liability shall be a refund of the paid\n\
purchase price for the defective Software only. This limited warranty is\n\
only valid if Xored receives written notice of breach of warranty no\n\
later than thirty (30) days after the warranty period expires. EXCEPT\n\
FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7, XORED DISCLAIMS\n\
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n\
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND\n\
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\
\n\
9. Limitation of Liability\n\
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will\n\
Xored be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential\n\
damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software,\n\
including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work\n\
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other\n\
commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility\n\
thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort\n\
or otherwise) upon which the claim is based. In any case, Xored’s entire\n\
liability under any provision of this agreement shall not exceed in the\n\
aggregate the sum of the license fees Licensee paid to Xored for the\n\
Software giving rise to such damages, notwithstanding any failure of\n\
essential purpose of any limited remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow\n\
the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so\n\
this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable. Xored is not\n\
responsible for any liability arising out of content provided by\n\
Licensee or a third party that is accessed through the Software and/or\n\
any material linked through such content. Any data included in the\n\
Software upon shipment from Xored is for testing use only and Xored\n\
hereby disclaims any and all liability arising therefrom. The extent of\n\
Xored’s liability for the limited warranty section shall be as set forth\n\
therein.\n\
\n\
10. Indemnity\n\
You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Xored and its\n\
resellers from and against any and all claims, lawsuits and proceedings\n\
(collectively "Claims"), and all expenses, costs (including attorney's\n\
fees), judgments, damages and other liabilities resulting from such\n\
Claims, that arise or result from the use or distribution of Your\n\
Integrated Product (to the extent such Claims are not attributable to\n\
the Software component of such Integrated Product).\n\
\n\
11. Confidentiality\n\
Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to\n\
retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or\n\
disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being\n\
proprietary and/or confidential or that, by the nature of the\n\
circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be\n\
treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and expressly undertakes to\n\
make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and\n\
during the existence of this Agreement. However, neither party shall\n\
have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that\n\
(i) it received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to\n\
maintain such information in confidence; (ii) the disclosing party has\n\
disclosed to a third party without any obligation to maintain such\n\
information in confidence; (iii) was known to the receiving party prior\n\
to its disclosure by the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently\n\
developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential\n\
information of the disclosing party. Further, either party may disclose\n\
confidential information of the other party as required by governmental\n\
or judicial order, provided such party gives the other party prompt\n\
written notice prior to such disclosure and complies with any protective\n\
order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. Without limiting the\n\
foregoing, Licensee shall treat any source code for the Software as\n\
confidential information and shall not disclose, disseminate, or\n\
distribute such materials to any third party without Xored’s prior\n\
written permission. Each party’s obligations under this Section 10 shall\n\
apply at all times during the term of this Agreement and for two (2)\n\
years following termination of this Agreement.\n\
\n\

without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. The Uniform\n\
Computer Information Transactions Act and the United Nations Convention\n\
on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. If\n\
any provision of this Agreement is to be held unenforceable, such\n\
holding will not affect the validity of the other provisions hereof.\n\
Failure of a party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not\n\
constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right\n\
to enforce such provision.\n\
\n\
13. Entire Agreement\n\
This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties\n\
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and\n\
contemporaneous communications regarding the subject matter hereof.\n\
\n\

Agreement, or any rights or obligations under it, without Xored’s prior\n\
written consent.\n\

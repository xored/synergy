<h1>Usage Data Collector Terms of Use</h1>
<p>This document describes 
how Xored Software Inc. will treat the data provided by
individuals and organizations through the Usage Data Collector. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A unique id is
    generated for every workstation that submits
    data using the Usage Data Collector. This session id is transmitted every
    time data is sent to Xored Software. </li>
    <li>The data that is being collected relates to how you are 
    using Xored Software products, Eclipse platform and any
    third-party plug-ins that you have added to your Eclipse workspace.
    This includes, but is not limited to, information on plug-in names,
    version numbers, length of time spent in a specific editor/view or
    perspective, actions and commands that you invoked, etc. You can
    imagine it to be similar to &quot;click stream&quot; data that is
    collected at certain web sites.</li>
    <li>The Usage Data Collector
    may collect and transmit the country where you are located</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uses of the Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Xored Software may, in its sole discretion, make avaiable to
    organizations and individuals the non-private, aggregated data
    or otherwise non-personal information that it collects through
    the Usage Data Collector, such as usage statistics of Xored product. 
	</li>
    <li>The summary reports based on the data obtained may be published at
    <a href="http://udc.xored.com">udc.xored.com</a>. </li>
    <li>Potential uses of the summary reports may include, but not limited to:
    1)  usage of Xored Software products, Eclipse projects and third-party
    Eclipse plug-ins and 2) an estimate to the number of individuals using
    Xored Software products. It is expected that the summary reports and
    raw data may be used for other purposes that we have not envisioned at
    this point in time. Changes will be added accordingly to the Usage Data
    Collector Term of Use.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Interactions with
 the Usage Data Collector</h2>


<ul>
    <li>With your
    permission, the Usage Data Collector will periodically transmit your usage
    data to the Xored Software. The first time it attempts to
    transmit the data, you will be requested to grant permission of
    transmission. If you decline the request, the Usage Data Collector will
    stop functioning, until you decide to re-enable it. If you grant
    permission, you will have the option of allowing the Usage Data Collector
    to automatically transmit data without further interaction or to
    request your permission each time it attempts to transmit data.</li>
    <li>You can choose to
    limit the range of plug-ins on which the Usage Data Collector collects
    information. You may limit the list of plug-ins to be only those
    that are provided by Xored Software and the Eclipse Foundation. 
    In addition, you may exclude plug-ins that include a specific text string
    in their name. To limit the range of plug-in, go to the &quot;Usage Data Collection | Preview&quot; page in the workspace preferences and add one or more filters.</li>
	<li> At anytime, you 
    may view the data that is being collected. To view your current
    information, go to the 
    &quot;Usage Data Collection | Preview&quot; preferences page.</li>
    <li>After providing
	your initial permission, you may discontinue use of the Usage
	Monitor by turning off the &quot;Enable Capture&quot; checkbox
	on the &quot;Usage Data Collection&quot; preferences page.</li>
</ul>
